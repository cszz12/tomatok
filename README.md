## todo
- detect a interrupt to early quit the task

- reminds of planning, retrospect at begin/end time of day in https://www.managertoday.com.tw/books/view/59388?

- reminds me how to relax

- put some tasks into calendar.log
- scan the calendar every 1 hour to see what's pending, then remind me

- run `python tomatok.py str`, where str is a todo task, it will start a timer of 20min, then display every 1 min; the task will be put into the finished.log
- Alternatively, run `python tomatok.py i`, where i is a todo task index in the todo.log.
